    abstract = {O novo coronavírus (COVID-19) difundiu-se de maneira significante por todo o globo e tornou-se uma das grandes mazelas da contemporaneidade, impactando profundamente o Brasil, o qual configura como uma das nações mais afetadas pela doença. Desse modo, a necessidade por sistemas tecnológicos de combate à crise sanitária tornou-se ainda mais urgente nesse país. À vista disso, o presente artigo apresenta um estudo comparativo entre duas técnicas de modelagem e previsão de dados epidemiológicos associados à pandemia de Covid no Brasil, especificamente no estado de Santa Catarina. Essencialmente, foram concebidos modelos do tipo Non-Linear Autoregressive model with eXogenous input (NARX) polinomiais como contraponto à modelagem de séries temporais por meio da construção de redes neurais recorrentes da variante Long short-term memory (LSTM) para séries de dados correspondentes às quantidades de casos confirmados, óbitos, pacientes recuperados e leitos do sistema público de saúde ocupados por pacientes acometidos pela doença. O desempenho preditivo dos modelos, avaliado por meio da aplicação de métricas de desempenho tradicionais, mostrou que, para três das quatro séries temporais utilizadas para previsão, o modelo NARX obteve resultados mais satisfatórios.}

Neste trabalho diferentes métodos de Deep Learning disponı́veis na biblioteca OpenCV foram comparados para a detecção e contagem de pessoas em ambientes internos. Os métodos foram comparados quanto à sua precisão, revocação e tempo de detecção. Para a aplicação considerada, os resultados obtidos sugerem que o método YOLO (v3) apresenta um bom compromisso entre medida F1 e tempo de reconhecimento.

 abstract = {Tetris is one of the highest-grossing video games in all history and, despite of its age, remains quite popular. One of its most acclaimed versions was released in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and is often referred to as NES Tetris. This particular version of the game has led to the creation of the Classic Tetris World Championship (CTWC), resulting in growing popularity and alternative modes of gameplay. In one of such variants, players aim to clear as many lines as possible, with an additional constraint: piece rotations are not allowed. In this work we build and evaluate agents to play this particular variant of the game based on different metrics that grade board configurations. The relative importance of metrics is determined with the Particle Swarm Optimization. Our best results match those of top performing human players, even though the metrics we employ were not specifically developed for this game variant.}

Standards for RNA-Seq data analysis are, however, in its infancy when compared to those of microarrays. Clustering, which is essential for understanding gene expression data, has been widely investigated w.r.t. microarrays. In what concerns the clustering of RNA-Seq data, however, a number of questions remain open, resulting in a lack of guidelines to practitioners. Here we evaluate computational steps relevant for clustering cancer samples via an empirical analysis of 15mRNA-seq datasets. Our evaluation considers strategies regarding expression estimates, number of genes after non-specific filtering and data transformations. We evaluate the performance of four clustering algorithms and twelve distance measures, which are commonly used for gene expression analysis. Results support that clustering cancer samples based on a gene quantification should be preferred. The use of non-specific filtering leading to a small number of features (1,000) presents, in general, superior results. Data should be log-transformed previously to cluster analysis. Regarding the choice of clustering algorithms, Average-Linkage and k-medoids provide, in general, superior recoveries. Although specific cases can benefit from a careful selection of a distance measure, Symmetric Rank-Magnitude correlation provides consistent and sound results in different scenarios.}

 abstract = {Electricity consumption is growing rapidly worldwide. Renewable energy resources, such as solar energy, play a crucial role in this scenario, contributing to satisfy demand sustainability. Although the share of Photovoltaic (PV) power generation has increased in the past years, PV systems are quite sensitive to climatic and meteorological conditions, leading to undesirable power production variability. In order to improve energy grid stability, reliability, and management, accurate forecasting models that relate operational conditions to power output are needed. In this work we evaluate the performance of regression methods applied to forecast short term (next day) energy production of a PV Plant. Specifically, we consider five regression methods and different configurations of feature sets. Our results suggest that MLP and SVR provide the best forecasting results, in general. Also, although features based on different solar irradiance levels play a key role in predicting power generation, the use of additional features can improve prediction results.}

abstract={The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) Curve, referred to as AUC, is a well-known performance measure in the supervised learning domain. Due to its compelling features, it has been employed in a number of studies to evaluate and compare the performance of different classifiers. In this work, we explore AUC as a performance measure in the unsupervised learning domain, more specifically, in the context of cluster analysis. In particular, we elaborate on the use of AUC as an internal/relative measure of clustering quality, which we refer to as Area Under the Curve for Clustering (AUCC). We show that the AUCC of a given candidate clustering solution has an expected value under a null model of random clustering solutions, regardless of the size of the dataset and, more importantly, regardless of the number or the (im)balance of clusters under evaluation. In addition, we elaborate on the fact that, in the context of internal/relative clustering validation as we consider, AUCC is actually a linear transformation of the Gamma criterion from Baker and Hubert (1975), for which we also formally derive a theoretical expected value for chance clusterings. We also discuss the computational complexity of these criteria and show that, while an ordinary implementation of Gamma can be computationally prohibitive and impractical for most real applications of cluster analysis, its equivalence with AUCC actually unveils a much more efficient algorithmic procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by experimental results. These results show that, in addition to an effective and robust quantitative evaluation provided by AUCC, visual inspection of the ROC curves themselves can be useful to further assess a candidate clustering solution from a broader, qualitative perspective as well.},

The current work presents an Industry 4.0 system developed for monitoring and controlling a 5-axis CNC machine center, in real time, through a mobile device, providing important feedback information for users and manufacturers of the machine. Given that response time is crucial in such applications, we conducted an experimental investigation to examine the system latency with distinct database structures, based on SQL and NoSQL. The results suggest that the non-relational structure (NoSQL) presented lower response times and is, thus, best suited for the application in hand.

Whereas the Pearson correlation coefficient appears as the de facto proximity measure in this scenario, no comprehensive study analyzing other correlation coefficients as alternatives to it has been conducted. Considering such facts, we evaluated five correlation coefficients (along with Euclidean distance) regarding the clustering of cancer samples. Our evaluation was conducted on 35 publicly available datasets covering both (i) intrinsic separation ability and (ii) clustering predictive ability of the correlation coefficients. Our results support that correlation coefficients rarely considered in the gene expression literature may provide competitive results to more generally employed ones.

abstract = {Decision-tree induction algorithms are widely used in knowledge discovery and data mining, specially in scenarios where model comprehensibility is desired. A variation of the traditional univariate approach is the so-called oblique decision tree, which allows multivariate tests in its non-terminal nodes. Oblique decision trees can model decision boundaries that are oblique to the attribute axes, whereas univariate trees can only perform axis-parallel splits. The vast majority of the oblique and univariate decision-tree induction algorithms employ a top-down strategy for growing the tree, relying on an impurity-based measure for splitting nodes. In this paper, we propose BUTIF—a novel Bottom-Up Oblique Decision-Tree Induction Framework. BUTIF does not rely on an impurity-measure for dividing nodes, since the data resulting from each split is known a priori. For generating the initial leaves of the tree and the splitting hyperplanes in its internal nodes, BUTIF allows the adoption of distinct clustering algorithms and binary classifiers, respectively. It is also capable of performing embedded feature selection, which may reduce the number of features in each hyperplane, thus improving model comprehension. Different from virtually every top-down decision-tree induction algorithm, BUTIF does not require the further execution of a pruning procedure in order to avoid overfitting, due to its bottom-up nature that does not overgrow the tree. We compare distinct instances of BUTIF to traditional univariate and oblique decision-tree induction algorithms. Empirical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.}

abstract={Evaluation and validation are essential tasks for achieving meaningful clustering results. Relative validity criteria are measures usually employed in practice to select and validate clustering solutions, as they enable the evaluation of single partitions and the comparison of partition pairs in relative terms based only on the data under analysis. There is a plethora of relative validity measures described in the clustering literature, thus making it difficult to choose an appropriate measure for a given application. One reason for such a variety is that no single measure can capture all different aspects of the clustering problem and, as such, each of them is prone to fail in particular application scenarios. In the present work, we take advantage of the diversity in relative validity measures from the clustering literature. Previous work showed that when randomly selecting different relative validity criteria for an ensemble (from an initial set of 28 different measures), one can expect with great certainty to only improve results over the worst criterion included in the ensemble. In this paper, we propose a method for selecting measures with minimum effectiveness and some degree of complementarity (from the same set of 28 measures) into ensembles, which show superior performance when compared to any single ensemble member (and not just the worst one) over a variety of different datasets. One can also expect greater stability in terms of evaluation over different datasets, even when considering different ensemble strategies. Our results are based on more than a thousand datasets, synthetic and real, from different sources.},

abstract = {Background: Clustering is crucial for gene expression data analysis. As an unsupervised exploratory procedure its results can help researchers to gain insights and formulate new hypothesis about biological data from microarrays. Given different settings of microarray experiments, clustering proves itself as a versatile exploratory tool. It can help to unveil new cancer subtypes or to identify groups of genes that respond similarly to a specific experimental condition. In order to obtain useful clustering results, however, different parameters of the clustering procedure must be properly tuned. Besides the selection of the clustering method itself, determining which distance is going to be employed between data objects is probably one of the most difficult decisions. Results and conclusions: We analyze how different distances and clustering methods interact regarding their ability to cluster gene expression, i.e., microarray data. We study 15 distances along with four common clustering methods from the literature on a total of 52 gene expression microarray datasets. Distances are evaluated on a number of different scenarios including clustering of cancer tissues and genes from short time-series expression data, the two main clustering applications in gene expression. Our results support that the selection of an appropriate distance depends on the scenario in hand. Moreover, in each scenario, given the very same clustering method, significant differences in quality may arise from the selection of distinct distance measures. In fact, the selection of an appropriate distance measure can make the difference between meaningful and poor clustering outcomes, even for a suitable clustering method.}

A number of different relative validity criteria have been proposed for the validation of globular, clusters. Not all data, however, are composed of globular clusters. Density-based clustering algorithms seek partitions with high density areas of points (clusters, not necessarily globular) separated by low density areas, possibly containing noise objects. In these cases relative validity indices proposed for globular cluster validation may fail. In this paper we propose a relative validation index for density-based, arbitrarily shaped clusters. The index assesses clustering quality based on the relative density connection between pairs of objects. Our index is formulated on the basis of a new kernel density function, which is used to compute the density of objects and to evaluate the within- and between-cluster density connectedness of clustering results. Experiments on synthetic and real world data show the effectiveness of our approach for the evaluation and selection of clustering algorithms and their respective appropriate parameters. }

These criteria are endowed with particular features that may make each of them more suitable for specific classes of problems. Nevertheless, the performance of each criterion is usually unknown a priori by the user. Hence, choosing a specific criterion is not a trivial task. A possible approach to circumvent this drawback consists of combining different relative criteria in order to obtain more robust evaluations. However, this approach has so far been applied in an ad-hoc fashion only; its real potential is actually not well-understood. In this paper, we present an extensive study on the combination of relative criteria considering both synthetic and real datasets. The experiments involved 28 criteria and 4 different combination strategies applied to a varied collection of data partitions produced by 5 clustering algorithms. In total, 427,680 partitions of 972 synthetic datasets and 14,000 partitions of a collection of 400 image datasets were considered. Based on the results, we discuss the shortcomings and possible benefits of combining different relative criteria into a committee.},

Besides selecting a clustering algorithm, choosing an appropriate proximity measure (similarity or distance) is of great importance to achieve satisfactory clustering results. Nevertheless, up to date, there are no comprehensive guidelines concerning how to choose proximity measures for clustering microarray data. Pearson is the most used proximity measure, whereas characteristics of other ones remain unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the choice of proximity measures for the clustering of microarray data by evaluating the performance of 16 proximity measures in 52 data sets from time course and cancer experiments. Our results support that measures rarely employed in the gene expression literature can provide better results than commonly employed ones, such as Pearson, Spearman, and euclidean distance. Given that different measures stood out for time course and cancer data evaluations, their choice should be specific to each scenario. To evaluate measures on time-course data, we preprocessed and compiled 17 data sets from the microarray literature in a benchmark along with a new methodology, called Intrinsic Biological Separation Ability (IBSA). Both can be employed in future research to assess the effectiveness of new measures for gene time-course data.}
