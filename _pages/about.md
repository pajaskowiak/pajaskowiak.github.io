I obtained a Bachelor degree in Informatics (aka Computer Science) from [UNIOESTE](http://unioeste.br) (2008). Both my MSc and PhD degrees were obtained at [ICMC](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/) / [University of São Paulo (USP)](http://usp.br), in 2011 and 2015, respectivelly. During my PhD I was a visiting researcher at [CIn](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/) / [UFPE](https://www.ufpe.br/) (2012) and at the [Department of Computing Science](https://www.ualberta.ca/computing-science/index.html) / [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) (2013-2014). After my PhD studies I was a postdoc at [ICMC](https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/) / [University of São Paulo (USP)](http://usp.br) (2015-2016), lefting for my current position at UFSC. In 2022 I was a visiting scholar funded by the [DAAD](https://www.daad.org/en/) at the [Costa Lab](https://costalab.org/) / [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/).

My research interests are broadly within machine learning, data mining and their applications. My personal research topics are mostly related with [cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) and clustering validation. I also performed investigations related to feature selection and missing value imputation. Regarding ml/dm applications, recently I've been working with forecasting (e.g., in water demand and photovoltaics) and fault detection (e.g., motor failures).

Currently I'm the coordinator of [PPGESE](https://ppgese.joinville.ufsc.br/).
