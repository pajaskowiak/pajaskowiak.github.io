#### Undergraduate Courses

I teach undergraduate courses for Engineering (Mechatronics and Logistics). Since 2016, I've been teaching:

**EMB5630 Programação II**

The course is basically data structures in C. It covers pointers, files, recursion, structs, abstract data types, linked lists, stacks, queues, tress, binary trees, binary search trees, and sorting algorithms.

**EMB5938 Grafos e Redes**

Graphs and networks for engineering, covering: basic concepts, graph traversal, shortest paths, maximum flow, minimum spanning trees, location of centers, medians, set covering, set partitioning, and coloring.

**EMB5617 Sistemas Inteligentes**

Classical AI search procedures, intelligent systems applications, and machine learning concepts. Regarding the latter, it covers unsupervised (clustering) and supervised learning methods (classification and regression).

#### Graduate Courses (Master's Level)

I've been teaching the following courses at [PPGESE](https://ppgese.joinville.ufsc.br/).

**ESE410035 - Introdução ao Aprendizado de Máquina**

Introduction to machine learning. Supervised methods for classification and regression: kNN, NN, MLP, SVM, SVR, and Decision Tree Models. Cluster analysis basics, covering k-means and hierarchical methods. Metrics for model evaluation covering both the supervised and unsupervised setting. Applications in Engineering. 

**ESE410019 - Metodologia Científica**

Research 101 - The basics of research methods.
